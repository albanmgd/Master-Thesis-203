# Master-Thesis-203

This is the repository associated to my master's thesis named *Realized Volatility forecasting using Machine Learning* for my first year within the MSc 203 Financial Market at Paris Dauphine University.

The folders within the code correspond to the different chapters inside the master's thesis and once the packages in the requirements file are installed, most of the code is ready to go. 
Parts of the code uses Polars for the sake of getting more experience with this package but not all given time constraints and task prioritization. 

If you notice any flaws, mistakes, ways of improvements or just want to discuss about it, please feel free to reach out to me at: magerandalban@gmail.com
